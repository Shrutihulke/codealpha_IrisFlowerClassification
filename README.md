Used measurements of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) as input data. 
Trained a machine learning model to classify the species based on these measurements. 
Used libraries like Scikit-learn for easy dataset access and model building. 
Evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance using test data.
